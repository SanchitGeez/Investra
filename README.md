## Installation

### Option 1: Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up Investra locally:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SanchitGeez/Investra.git
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

For the frontend:

```bash
cd client/
npm install
npm start
```

For the backend:

```bash
cd backend/
npm install
node server.js
```

#### 3. Run the Application

Open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Option 2: Run Backend Using Docker

You can alternatively run the backend using Docker. Follow these steps:

#### 1. Build and Run Docker Containers

Make sure Docker is installed and running on your machine. Then, in the `backend/` directory, run the following commands:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will spin up the backend server along with a MongoDB database inside Docker containers.

#### 2. Verify the Backend

Once the containers are running, the backend will be available at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

By default, the MongoDB instance will be accessible on port `27017`, and the backend server will connect to it automatically.
